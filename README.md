For any issues, please write to: melchorherrera@gmail.com. We will gladly appreciate any bug reports.


## :rocket: Getting started

Once Your Online Shop is installed, you can open your browser at the correspondent url address. Lets log in with some of the admin users to make changes: user webadmin for web content and productsadmin for catalog content. Other operations can be done by user systemadmin, and to check customer orders, log in with ordersadmin.

After editing some content, press Intro or click outside the editable area to save changes.

To edit some features from the checkout process, you should log in with the systemadmin user and make an order as if you were a customer. Once you get to the checkout step, you should be able to edit the checkout options.

Some other configuration can be done by editing some cfg files.
